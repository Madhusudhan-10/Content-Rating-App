# Content-Rating-App
A React mini-project for rating content items (likes/dislikes). Built as part of IBM Full Stack Developer Certificate.
A simple React mini-project that allows users to like or dislike multiple content items.
This project started as a lab exercise in the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate, and I upgraded it into a reusable and professional mini-project.

Features:

✅ Rate multiple items individually (like/dislike).

✅ Clean UI with modern styling.

✅ Built with React Hooks (useState).

✅ Beginner-friendly and extendable.
